                    <p>
                        In my undergraduate study, I majored in Integrative Systems and Design. <a href="https://isd.hkust.edu.hk/">The Division of Integrative Systems and Design</a> is a established in 2018 and I am the first batch's student. The mission
                        of the Division of Integrative Systems and Design is to nurture a new generation of innovators who can work across multiple disciplines and create disruptive innovations to solve the world’s great challenges. More frankly, we were
                        taught how to define and solve the right problem and taught how to master a certain skill and implement it rapidly.<br> Every year start from year 2, ISD will have a year-long or two semester-long projects. And each project will
                        be scoped inside a theme. For me, I have attend the following projects:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="">
                        <li><a href="motipot.html">Year 2 project (Motipot)</a>: Elderly Robotics</li>
                        <li><a href="mobee.html">Year 3 project (Mobee)</a>: Personal Mobility</li>
                        <li><a href="trocomotorFollower.html">Year 3 project (Trocomotor)</a>: Smart Airport (worked with Hong Kong International Airport)</li>
                        <li><a href="irlms.html">Final Year Project (IRLMS)</a>: Smart Construction (worked with Hong Kong Paul Y. Engineering)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Though in all project I mainly worked on mechanical design, manufacture and implementation, I get to know more about areas like embedded system, ROS, dynamic website. You may see more in details on project blog page.

                    <p>
                        <a href="https://urop.hkust.edu.hk/">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP)</a> is one of HKUST's signature programs designed to provide a unique opportunity for undergraduate students to engage in academic research
                        and help them develop a broad and insightful perspective of their areas of interest. In 2020 summer, I chose the topic of Robotics Gripper Development for Warehouse Automation. I worked on a gripper that is built using a kind of
                        gecko-inspired dry adhesive material. This project mainly focuses on material design, fabrication, and the mechanism mechanical design of the gripper.
