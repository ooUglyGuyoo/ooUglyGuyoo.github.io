                        This is the 2020-2021 Year 3 second semester project of ISD. This project worked with Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). The project vision a fully autonomous trolley hauling system (Trocomotor), since during interviews and shadowing, short of trolley
                        hauling workers was observed. But due to short of time and manpower, only part of the proposed system is built which can also improved the status of current working process. Current trolley hauling work is done by workers using
                        hauling scooters. But the scooters has limited power and limited space therefore can only handle around 20 trolleys at a time. Trocomotor follower can follow the track of the workers' scooters by tacking the Apriltag sticked behind
                        the scooter or the trolley. This allow workers to manipulate more trolleys at the same time by forming several trolley trains solving the power and space issue at the same time.

                        Our team did a site visit to HKIA and several interviews with their staff and workers. The airport staff express their concern to shortage of trolley hauling workers and financial burden. Less people want to work at the airport since it is far away from
                        residential areas and airport need to pay more and more to attract workers. But taking the project manpower and time as consideration, we also want our system to replace the workers gradually which means our first step need to
                        be working with them, so that we can start our project by doing part of the system.

                        This project focus on Trocomoter Follower. The Follower is a high power four wheel robot chassis with miniPC, high resolution camera and obstacle detection system (radar/ultrasonic sensors). The robot can haul up to 20 trolleys at the same time and by
                        using the camera, it can follow the track of an AprilTag. The workers can put the AprilTag on their scooters or at the back of another train of trolleys.
