                    <p>ISDN Year projects take place from UG year 2 to year 4. These projects are all year long projects with a theme or working with a company or organization. Students need to work within the theme given, to define and re-define the problems
                        by using design thinking technics before coming up with a solution that meets userâ€™s need. Students need to form team in which have students from different discipline (ME, EE, CS). At last, the team needs to work together to build
                        out a functional prototype for the solution they proposed which is called a Proof of Concept (PoC).</p>

                                ISD teach me to implement design thinking in all projects. Design thinking is an iterative process in which you seek to understand your users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions which you can prototype and test. The
                                overall goal is to identify alternative strategies and solutions that are not instantly apparent with your initial level of understanding.

                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3"><u>Project Process</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        Usually, a typical ISD project follows these processes:
                    </p>
                    <ol class="mb-5">
                        <li class="mb-2">Topic selection and scoping</li>
                        <p>The topic is scoped based on either professor's requirement or industrial partners.</p>
                        <li class="mb-2">Empathize</li>
                        <p>Based on the topic selected, we will do shadowing, interviews, observations, studies or investigation on our potential target users</p>
                        <li class="mb-2">Define and redefine the problems</li>
                        <p>Usually, one cannot identify the problems right, that is why we need to find the RIGHT problem by empathizing. We might need to do this for several time until we think we found the right problem that is worth solving</p>
                        <li class="mb-2">Ideation</li>
                        <p>To find the best solution to solve the problem we do literature review, brainstorming and technology research.</p>
                        <li class="mb-2">Prototyping</li>
                        <p>Functional prototype (Proof of Concept) will be built to implement our solution idea.</p>
                        <li class="mb-2">Testing</li>
                        <p>Tests will be done on the prototype and several prototypes and tests might need to be done to reach our expectation.</p>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        For me, I have attend the following projects:
